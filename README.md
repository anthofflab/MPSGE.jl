## Overview

This package provides a [MPSGE](https://www.gams.com/solvers/mpsge/index.htm) implementation in Julia.
<p> (As of July 2023) the initital development is nearly complete and the package is ready for testing. <a href="https://anthofflab.berkeley.edu/MPSGE.jl/dev/">Documentation</a> is coming soon. In the meantime, while the Julia syntax is obviously different than the GAMS version, the linked page above for the original MPSGE has great explanations of the structure, features, and theory. The examples illustrate the Julia syntax as currently implemented.
