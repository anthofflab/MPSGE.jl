# MPSGE.jl

MPSGE.jl is a Julia evolution of the GAMS MPSGE subsystem [MPSGE](https://www.gams.com/solvers/mpsge/index.htm)

The [Documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html) for MPSGE should be useful to reference, especially for background, theory, and for some understanding of [features](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html#UG_MPSGE_Intro_KeywordsSyntax) while the MPSGE.jl is still being written.

The documentation here will probably grow in fits and starts. Please give us feedback as we go and let us know what would be especially helpful.
