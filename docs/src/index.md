# [MPSGE.jl](https://github.com/julia-mpsge/MPSGE.jl)

MPSGE.jl is a Julia evolution of the [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/) subsystem [MPSGE](https://www.gams.com/solvers/mpsge/index.htm). The [Documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html) for the GAMS MPSGE should be useful to reference, especially for background, theory, and for some understanding of the included [features](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html#UG_MPSGE_Intro_KeywordsSyntax), especially while the MPSGE.jl documentation is still being written.

The [Tutorial](./tutorial.md) includes links to install Julia and the package, as well as the suggestion that as the tagged version of the package may not always be up-to-date as things are still in active development, adding MPSGE#main instead will get you the latest working development version of the package.

The documentation here will probably grow in fits and starts. Please give us feedback as we go, and let us know what breaks, and what would be especially helpful.
