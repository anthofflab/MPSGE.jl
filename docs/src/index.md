# MPSGE.jl

MPSGE.jl is a Julia evolution of the GAMS [MPSGE](https://www.gams.com/solvers/mpsge/index.htm) subsystem.

The [Documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html) for MPSGE should be useful to reference, especially for background, theory, and for some understanding of [features](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html#UG_MPSGE_Intro_KeywordsSyntax) while the MPSGE.jl documentation is still being written.

As we're still in development, tagging can lag a bit. To load the most current version of main (which may be ahead of the tagged registered version), run "add MPSGE#main" in the package handler ("]" in VS code), or Pkg.add("MPSGE#main"), which will establish the current version of the main branch as the package.

The documentation here will probably grow in fits and starts. Please give us feedback as we go, and let us know what would be especially helpful.
